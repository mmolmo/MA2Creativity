        For this particular assignment, I am proud to showcase a few major projects that I created for an Intro to Design class last semester. As an artist, I take pride in my ability to incorporate various techniques and mediums into my work. This collection features some of my favorite pieces that I created during the course. Each work is unique and employs different fundamental design concepts that best describe my creative vision. They also utilize a variety of mediums, such as cut paper and watercolor. I hope you enjoy the experience of looking through each of these pieces.
